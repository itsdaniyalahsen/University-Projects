## Project 1: House Application - C++

Draws a house of base length, you have the ability to modify it to your will. This model has different fill in and border characters. The Model is a equilateral traingle with each side of length (base+2) atop a square of base length. My first university project.

The Fill in and border characters are supposed to lie between ASCII 33 and ASCII 137. No mechanism for exceptions has been added. This will be corrected later on. Also different colors support will be added later on.
